This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Problem Statement:
### Bank has information on the spred based on hte range of interest coverage ratio and rating 
#### 1. Check if the mean of Interest Coverage Ratio for Large Manufacturing firm is similar to Financial Service Firm
#### 2. Check if the mean of Interest Coverage Ratio for Large manufacturing firm is similar to Financial service Firm and Smaller and riskier Firm 

## Load data
```{r}
icr <- read.csv(
  "data/Interest Coverage Ratio.csv",
  sep =",",
  header = TRUE, 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(icr)
str(icr)
```
## Data exploration
```{r}
## Check for missing value 
nrow(icr[!complete.cases(icr), ])
# No missing values


## Checl for Outliers 
boxplot(icr$LargeManufFirmGT)
summary(icr$LargeManufFirmGT)


boxplot(icr$FinancialServiceFirmsGT)
summary(icr$FinancialServiceFirmsGT)

boxplot(icr$SmallerAndRiskierFirmsGT)
summary(icr$SmallerAndRiskierFirmsGT)

ggplot(icr,aes(x=LargeManufFirmGT,y=FinancialServiceFirmsGT))+
  geom_point(shape=21,color="mediumvioletred",fill ="red",size=4)


ggplot(icr,aes(x=LargeManufFirmGT,y=LargeManufFirmLT))+geom_point(shape=1)

```
## Analysis
```{r}
## Run t-test to check if there is difference in rate from source-1 and source-2 
## Formulate Hypothesis
## - Null Hypothesis - Means of Interest Coverage Ratio for Large Manufacturing Firm is similar to Financial Service Firm
## - Alternate Hypothesis - Mean of Interest Coverage Ratio is different
t.test(icr$LargeManufFirmGT,icr$FinancialServiceFirmsGT)

# p value is less than .05
# so we should reject the 


## Run Anova to check if there is difference in rates from different sources 
## Formulate Hypothesis
## Null Hypothesis - Mean of Interest Coverage Ratios of Large Manufacturing Firm, Financial Service Firm and Smaller and Riskier Firm are same
## Alternate Hypothesis: Mean of Interest Coverage Ratio is different
fit<- aov(icr$LargeManufFirmGT~icr$FinancialServiceFirmsGT+icr$SmallerAndRiskierFirmsGT)
fit
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
